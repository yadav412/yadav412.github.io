          <p>professor : Dr Felix Lo</p>
          <p class="tex">An interesting first year class, introducing comp sci kids to academic writing. Personally this was not a bad class, I did enjoy writing papers but the delivery and teaching staff did not make this a favourite. </P>
          <p class="tex">The area I chose to research throughout the semester was Deepfake technology this did give me an oppurtunity to have a look into AI and how it is used in visual computing.</p>

          <p>professor : Bobby Chan</p>
          <p class="tex">This is a first year course that introduces students to the world of computer science. The course covers the basics of programming, algorithms, and data structures. It is a great way to get started in the field and learn the fundamentals of computer science.</p>
          <p class="tex">The course is taught by Bobby Chan, who is a great by far one of my favourites, would recommend him to anyone. This was a class that really helped me solidify my python coding skills to a well hone sharpened tool. </p>

           <p>professor : Dr Yonas Tesfazghi Weldeselassie </p>
           <p class="tex">This was my first introduction to c++, This was also one of those coding classes where everything was written on paper. Yonas was okay nothing to write home about, I prefered the approach from the previous more hands on classes than this one.</p>
           <p class="tex">There was also some technical issues on my end when using an IDE, we were not allowed to use visual studio definitly a reason for why C++ is not my prefered languages.</p>

          <p>professor: Dr David Mitchell</p>
          <p class="tex">Introduction to data structures. What can I say I call this the leetcode prep class, cause in the moment as a second year this class is not as useful as it will be down the line. David in his sun set lap as a proffesor kind of let everything unravel at points through the semester coming off 125 which was already not pleasant was not a good feeling.</p>
          <p class="tex">The class was not bad, I did learn a lot about data structures and how they work. The assignments were challenging but not impossible.</p>

          <p class = "tex">Intro to foundational theories in psychology. This was a really insightful class, Caroline was really insightful and really friendly in her office hours. The midterms were abit tough, with the grading being rather strict. </p>
          <p class="tex">The class covered a wide range of topics, including cognitive psychology, social psychology, and developmental psychology. It is a class that I recommend to all interested in psychology, it is also a good guage to see if you enjoy it or not.</p>

          <p class="tex">The class covered a wide range of topics, including cognitive psychology, social psychology, and developmental psychology just like in psychology 100. </p>

          <p class="tex">Introduction to biological psychology, covering the relationship between biology and behavior. This class is super content heavy but Dr Caldbick made the class really enjoyable. The lectures were engaging and the assignments were fun to do.</p>
          <p class="tex">The class covered a wide range of topics, including the nervous system, the endocrine system, and the immune system. It was for me an a stepping stone for me to get into more computer-psychology related classes in the future. </p>
